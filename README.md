# Car_logo-Classifier
This is a neural network image classifier that helps to identify 10 different classes of car brands.

# Neural Network

The neural network used is a Convoluted Neural network (CNN) with an architecture similar to the AlexNet (made by Prof. Alex Krizhevsky of University of Toronto). The neural network was trained on 10 categories containing 1000 images each. The test set consisted of 150 images per category. After running for 15 epoch the the model achieved a validation accuracy of 98% and validation loss of 0.37!

# The categories

1) Buick
2) Chery
3) Citroen
4) Honda
5) Hyundai
6) Lexus
7) Mazda
8) Peugeot
9) Toyota
10) Volkswagen
